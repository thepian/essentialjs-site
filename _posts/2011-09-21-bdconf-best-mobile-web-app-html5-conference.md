Looking at one of the presentations from the recent [BD Conf](http://bdconf.com), I wonder if I missed the conference of the year. [Scott Jehl](http://twitter.com/#!/scottjehl) presented the design they made for [The Boston Globe](http://www.bostonglobe.com/) 

It is indeed an impressive presentation of an equally impressive site. It presents the classic newspaper grid on a very wide range of devices.
I think we know a lot about the nature of such content, so figuring out how to layout that on a range of devices is much easier than for other types of sites where the nature of the content is still being figured out.

Never the less so far I have several projects to have a look at,

* [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond)
* [ResponsiveImages.js](https://github.com/filamentgroup/Responsive-Images)
* [320andup](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/)

It looks like nice work so far.
