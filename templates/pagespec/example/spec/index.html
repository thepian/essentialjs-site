	<h2>Specifications for {{ account }} / {{ project }} </h2>
	<p>The common way to run Specs is to execute in the loading page with the examples running in a hidden scope. The examples will have to leave the DOM unchanged, or restore them upon completion. The running will create a results IFRAME for posting the results.

	<h2>Upload</h2>
	<p>If you link to the specifications within this document they will be automatically uploaded when you open or refresh this page.</p>
