	<h2>Specifications for {{ account }} / {{ project }} </h2>
	<p>The common way to run Specs is to execute in the loading page with the examples running in a hidden scope. The examples will have to leave the DOM unchanged, or restore them upon completion. The running will create a results IFRAME for posting the results.

	<h2>Kicking off the suite</h2>
	<p>You can kick off a suite of Specifications by opening the <a href="runner.html">Runner</a> page.
	If you save(just the HTML file as it is) together with your source code locally, it can be run
	by simply opening the file with a web browser.</p>
